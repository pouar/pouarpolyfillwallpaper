This is a wallpaper app for Plasma Desktop 5 that uses librsvg to parse SVGs as QtSvg only supports the SVG Tiny subset.

This app was mostly designed for personal use rather than end use, for example, the path to the folder containing the wallpapers is hardcoded as I never created an interface to change it as I don't change that part very often. But I decided to publish it anyway in case someone wants to use it or the code.
